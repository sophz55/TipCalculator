## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Settings page to change the number of people the bill is split over
- [x] Tip options include a hidden slider for more tip percentage options

## Notes

Challenges:
In this assignment, I found it challenging to acquant myself with the various tools we will be using. Getting used to the syntax and structures of Obejective-C and learning how to use Xcode came as the main challenges of the day, but it was ultimately rewarding to figure out how things work through trial-and-error and documentation searches.
